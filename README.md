# Dirspync
## DIRectory SYNCing tool written in PYthon

This is not a standard backup tool, though it can be used to back up. It allows
you to easily synchronize files across multiple directories (usually on
different devices) while still retaining fine-grained control over which files
are copied where.

This is a tool I wrote when I was a much less experienced programmer and much of
it is legacy code, though I have recently begun to revisit it. It still needs a
lot more automated testing, refactoring and documentation.
