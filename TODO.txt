TODO what about when the datestamp is the same but the size is different?
TODO not sizing currectly when there are Chinese characters in file name.
     (what about other composite characters, e.g. á¾†?)
Refactor:
  + Everything... wrote this several years ago and it is VERY messy
  + File should not have a fancy() method, so make dsTerm into dsFancyPrinter
    (the Terminal module is sparse anyway, and no other part of the program
    cares about the width of the terminal).
